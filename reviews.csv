Possibly the best bartender there would be Phillip. He was more than welcoming and deserves a raise,5,The Crooked Knife,Gastropub
Service isnt good for a big group. They can automatically charge the service fee without providing good or any service. I would not do bottomless. Drinks are terrible and server doesnt come around.

And the dessert a fitting end to a wonderful evening. Service was attentive without interrupting,5,Marc Forgione,American restaurant
"Wanted to like it but it food was inconsistent and expensive. $100 per person for appetizers, an entree and a drink. Most entrees are $40-45 and while nicely presented and solid, its not worth the price tag. Nice atmosphere. Better place to get a drink/appetizers",3,Marc Forgione,American restaurant

NOT TODDLER FRIENDLY. They would only seat the 3 of us at a table for 2 right next the door and the place was empty. We went early. My toddler always orders his own entree.

The monster cookie ice cream was delicious as were all the toppings incorporated. The serving size was a little excessive and there was no seating to enjoy the mason jar.,4,Surreal Creamery,Ice cream shop
Awesome Ice Cream place in NYC. They got their signature combos and also make your own style ice creams.A must go place for their Ice Creams. Chocolate blackout and Nom Nom Cookie are my favorites. Im going here again when Im in NYC.,5,Surreal Creamery,Ice cream shop
The drinks here are soooooo good. Just take into account that they melt pretty fast in the summer and there is no where to sit down inside the restaurant (or anywhere outside).,4,Surreal Creamery,Ice cream shop

Hello public. First I want to say their Taro bubble tea ice cream shakes are very good. But the price has increased $3 since I started going. The price for an ice cream bubble tea has increased nearing $12.00. unfortunately that's my tap-out. I'm going to miss you. Not good.,4,Surreal Creamery,Ice cream shop

I finally got a chance to come down here (from seeing a TikTok ) It was well worth it and a great experience! We went for the viet/Thai and matcha/taro options. The coffee ice cream is strong but the Thai tea helps give it the sweeter taste. There are definitely many other options to try with the neat combinations they have. ,5,Surreal Creamery,Ice cream shop

The taro bubble tea also tasted very watered down. The line was long and overall this spot is a bit overhyped.",4,Surreal Creamery,Ice cream shop

AMAZING 2*  Michelin  restaurant. Food and  experience outstanding. Highly recommend,5,Atera,New American restaurant
It is a 18-course tasting menu but you gotta count loosely because some of the dessert courses are pretty small & still considered as a course.A popular molecular gastronomy spot in NYC! Worth checking out.The place is small - with a few counter seats and a separate table for four. That's why so difficult to make a reservation :P,5,Atera,New American restaurant
"The toasted rye, king crab, and crispy skin wafer was divine. What I love about it was the chicken skin comes in first, and then melts downward to coalesce with the king crab. The rye played a supportive role in structure as well as taste to uphold the meats. I wish I could have ate a barrel of these things!",5,Atera,New American restaurant
